Reflection Paper on Csci130
By Isaac Sanchez

I am not really an very good coder, so when I first thought about learning HTML in this class I had visions of laboring endlessly through long nights of scripting confusion and turmoil PHP code. I always like to code with c,c++,functional programming, HTML, java scriptingfor the past 4 years and I have seen the evolution of web site design in the industry and was feeling left behind.But when Todd mention Go Language as a primary web desing code I got really interested.

When I began this class I did not know the first thing about Go Language. There is not much information about the language or a textbook to get familiar with it. The only reliable source was Todds Knowledge and the main Go Language website. The assignments were laid out clear with an acceptable level of difficulty increase with each one. The practice pages that were developed helped in the understanding of Go Language run smooth. This class is fun! Wow! I would find myself going over different options and choices and actually understanding Go! Most of the links and information provided in the course gave me a great insight into all of the web site design in Go. Todd had very good resources as well and his personal notes helped more clearly.

I might add that my website design experience turned out pretty to be much better, even if I have not learned the whole potential of the language, but go seems to take that to another level.

I have to say that this class has definitely shown me the tools and also provided me with the confidence to continue creating web sites not just thru HTML, or what is in industry as PHP, HTML5, etc, but in Go language. in the near future, I plan on creating my own business web site and see where this leads.


I really enjoyed this class, Thanks Todd!!
